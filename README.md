Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

for project two we had to complete the Q-training algorithm, the code starts a qmaze object in wich it defines the maze and its enviroment as well this stores IA score and experience, next the IA would perform numerous of epochs this would reset the maze and the IA would run the maze until the end of the maze multiple times, the IA everythime would try to improve obtain more points and find the faster way out in addition the IA would choose either exploration or exploitation.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
first thing would be define the problem as well understand the problem.  having a clear understanding of the problem helps with having a positive outcome. implementing different solution and using different types of testing methods and then lastly reflecting so later on you can use this problem if it where to happend again to you or any peers. 

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
 ensuring that im always using safe codes, not violating others private data, following laws. when creating something you always need to think about others how consummers are going to use the tools they have created.
